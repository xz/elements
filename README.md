# All HTML Elements

‚ú® View in your browser at [https://xz.github.io/html-elements/src/index.html](https://xz.github.io/html-elements/src/index.html).

A simple list of all visible and style-able HTML elements. The list itself does not style any of these elements, so it's perfect for testing CSS frameworks, browser compatibility, and more.

## üõ† Usage

In your terminal of choice, run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xz/html-elements.git
```
This will create a folder titled `html-elements`. Just open the folder, open `src`, then the included `index.html` file with your browser. Probably the simplest install across all of Github.
