# xz/html-elements

A simple list of all visible and style-able HTML elements. The list itself does not style any of these elements, so it's perfect for testing CSS frameworks, browser compatibility, and more.

## 🛠 Usage

In your terminal of choice, run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xz/html-elements.git
```
This will create a folder titled `html-elements`. Just open the folder, open `src`, then the included `index.html` file with your browser. Probably the simplest install across all of Github.
